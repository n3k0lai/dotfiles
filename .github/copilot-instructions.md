This is a repository that manages my NixOS configuration using home-manager and flakes. It is stored at ~/Code/nix.

This repo often manages config code within the home directory. This repo has common dotfiles that are symlinked to ~/.config and ~/.local/share as needed.

modules/editors/vscode handles copilot's configuration for VSCode.

When given the option, always prefer fish over bash.

When deciding on architectural decisionmaking and problem solving, refer to https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles for inspiration.

When i talk to you, if I mention `./.` that means the root of this repository at ~/Code/nix.
